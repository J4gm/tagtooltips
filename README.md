# TAG TOOLTIPS

**Available for Fabric, NeoForge, and Forge!**

### FEATURES

While holding a configurable keybind (**semicolon by default**) an item's tooltip will display all of the item tags it belongs to, as well as:

* Block tags if it's a block.
* Entity type tags if it's a spawn egg.
* Fluid tags if it's a bucket.
* Enchantment tags if it's an enchanted book.
* POI type tags if it's a villager workstation, beehive, etc.

It will show tags from across all mods and namespaces. I hope this mod is useful for designing tag-based sorting systems, or for modders and pack creators who are debugging tag issues.
